# EEE4022S_Vital_Sign_Monitoring_using_FMCW_Radar
VitalProcessing.m is used to capture and process data immediately.
Can be used to capture multiple sets of data without processing and allows for processing to be repeated with different settings and parameters.

Proc.m is used to process and test data that has already been captured and works without the radar system being setup.
Is used to test and design the methods and algorithms for processing and extracting data.
# NB be carefull to go through the variables in the files and change them to the appropriate values for your system.
# This code was developed and tested specifically using the DCA1000EVM and AWR1642BOOST equipment and requires mmWaveStudio 02.01.01.00 version and its related software and setup to be completed properly.
